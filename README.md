My final project represents a version of a public library website. In my work I used such means of implementation as HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets),
JavaScript (slider) and PHP(scripts to send messages and the script for the guest book) programming languages.This digital library is a very interesting and useful web resource.
It is my first try on layout and coding. So don't be too harsh!
